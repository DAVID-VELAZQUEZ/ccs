## Quick Tools Overview

### [Circular Consensus Calling](doc/PBCCS.md)

`ccs` takes multiple reads of the same SMRTbell sequence and combines
them, employing a statistical model, to produce one high quality consensus sequence.

### Genomic Consensus Calling

`gcpp` will replace the current python [GenomicConsensus](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/GenomicConsensus), until then please use the existing solution.

### [Minor variant caller](https://github.com/pacificbiosciences/minorseq)

`juliet` identifies minor variants from aligned ccs reads; this tool has been moved to a new repository [MinorSeq](https://github.com/pacificbiosciences/minorseq)
