You probably don't have the access necessary to build this just yet, so please move along for now.

For those of you that do, you'll need pbbam from staging/PostPrimary, and ConsensusCore from lib/cpp *with* shelved changelist 148562. If you organize these on disk like they are in the depot under bioinformatics/..., then you'll just need to pass -DBifx_RootDir=/path/to/bioinformatics to cmake to have them automagically picked up.

If you want things to go fast, I highly recommend building both pbbam and pbccs with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release.

Watch this place, things will advance rapidly as features land.
