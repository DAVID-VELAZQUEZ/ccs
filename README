You probably don't have the access necessary to build this just yet, so please move along for now.

For those of you that do, you'll need pbbam and dependencies from staging/PostPrimary. If you organize these on disk like they are in the depot under bioinformatics/..., then you'll just need to pass -DBifx_RootDir=/path/to/bioinformatics to cmake to have them automagically picked up.

If you want things to go fast, I highly recommend building both pbbam and pbccs with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release.

Watch this place, things will advance rapidly as features land.
